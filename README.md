## What is NordLynx?

NordLynx is a technology built around the WireGuard® VPN protocol. It lets you experience WireGuard’s speed benefits without compromising your privacy. You can find more information about NordLynx in [this blog post](https://nordvpn.com/blog/nordlynx-protocol-wireguard/).

## What is WireGuard?

[WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/) is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.

## Road warriors, roaming and returning home

If you plan to use Wireguard both remotely and locally, say on your mobile phone, you will need to consider routing.
Most firewalls will not route ports forwarded on your WAN interface correctly to the LAN out of the box. This means that
when you return home, even though you can see the Wireguard server, the return packets will probably get lost.

This is not a Wireguard specific issue and the two generally accepted solutions are NAT reflection (setting your edge
router/firewall up in such a way as it translates internal packets correctly) or split horizon DNS (setting your
internal DNS to return the private rather than public IP when connecting locally).

Both of these approaches have positives and negatives however their setup is out of scope for this document as
everyone's network layout and equipment will be different.

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker-compose (recommended, [click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/compose/))

```yaml
---
version: "3"
services:
  nordlynx:
    image: ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordlynx
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN #required
    environment:
      - PRIVATE_KEY=xxxxxxxxx #required
```

### docker-compose (using secret)

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  nordlynx:
    image: ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordlynx
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN #required
    environment:
      - PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/privatekey
    secrets:
      - privatekey 
secrets:
  privatekey:
    file: ./privatekey.txt
```

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN #required \
  -e PRIVATE_KEY=xxxxxxxxx #required \
  ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordlynx
```

Review the [wiki](https://github.com/bubuntux/nordlynx/wiki) for more practical usages and host specific instructions.

## Module

Wireguard module is required, please install it [manually](https://www.wireguard.com/install) if need it.

### How To Get Your `PRIVATE_KEY`

To get your `PRIVATE_KEY` you will need to get an access token from the NordVPN website and then use the https://github.com/bubuntux/nordvpn container.

1. Log in to https://nordvpn.com/
2. On the left side, click on **NordVPN**
3. In the middle, under **Manual setup**, click on **Set up NordVPN manually** and go through the verification process
4. On the new page, in the middle, in the **Access token** box, click on **Generate new token**
5. In the **Generate new token?** pop-up box, select **Set to expire in 30 days** and click **Generate token**
6. In the **Copy access token** pop-up box, click the **Copy** linnk to copy your token
7. From your computer where Docker is installed, run the below command and replace `{{{TOKEN}}}` with what you copied from step 6 above:

    ```
    docker run --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -e TOKEN={{{TOKEN}}} ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordvpn:get_private_key
    ```

8. Docker will do it's thing and spit  out your `PRIVATE_KEY`:

    ```
    user@hostname:~/docker> docker run --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -e TOKEN=[redacted] ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordvpn:get_private_key

9. Copy everything after `Privatey Key: ` (note the space after `:`) to the end of the line -- this is your `PRIVATE_KEY`

## Sysctl

| Option | Details |
|:-------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1` | May be required; depends on multiple factors. |
| `net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1`   | Recommended when only using ipv4.             |

## Docker Compose Examples

### nordlynx VPN container

This example will start a nordlynx VPN container on a `legacy_p2p` VPN server.

``` yaml
services:
    nordlynx:
        image: ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordlynx
        hostname: nordlynx
        container_name: nordlynx
        cap_add:
            - NET_ADMIN                             # required
            - SYS_MODULE                            # maybe
        environment:
            - PRIVATE_KEY=[redacted]                # required
            - QUERY=filters\[servers_groups\]\[identifier\]=legacy_p2p
            - NET_LOCAL=192.168.0.0/16
            - TZ=America/New_York
        sysctls:
            - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1   # maybe
            - net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=2        # maybe; set reverse path filter to loose mode
            - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1     # disable ipv6; recommended if using ipv4 only
```

### Passing Another Container Through The nordlynx VPN Container

This example will create a [Firefox container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-firefox) that routes traffic through the nordlynx VPN container.

Typically, when you do port forwarding for a container (for example, to access it from your computer's browser), you do it on the container.

When you pass a container's traffic through another container (the nordlynx VPN container in this case), both/all containers are in the same network. As such, you no longer do port forwarding on the container you want to access and, instead, do it on the nordlynx VPN container.

Additionally, you need to ensure the second container starts **AFTER** the nordlynx VPN container.

``` yaml
services:
    nordlynx:
        image: ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordlynx
        hostname: nordlynx
        container_name: nordlynx
        ports:
            - "3000:3000" # port I want forwarded for the firefox container
            - "3001:3001" # port I want forwarded for the firefox container
        cap_add:
            - NET_ADMIN                             # required
            - SYS_MODULE                            # maybe
        environment:
            - PRIVATE_KEY=[redacted]                # required
            - QUERY=filters\[servers_groups\]\[identifier\]=legacy_p2p
            - NET_LOCAL=192.168.0.0/16
            - TZ=America/New_York
        sysctls:
            - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1   # maybe
            - net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=2        # maybe; set reverse path filter to loose mode
            - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1     # disable ipv6; recommended if using ipv4 only
        
    firefox:
        image: lscr.io/linuxserver/firefox:latest
        # hostname: firefox                        # won't work when you do network_mode
        container_name: firefox
        restart: unless-stopped
        depends_on:
            - nordlynx
        network_mode: service:nordlynx
        # ports:                                   # won't work; you need to do this in the nordlynx VPN container 
        #     - "3000:3000"                        # won't work; you need to do this in the nordlynx VPN container  
        #     - "3001:3001"                        # won't work; you need to do this in the nordlynx VPN container
        volumes:
            - /path/to/config:/config
        environment:
            - PUID=1000
            - PGID=1000
            - TZ=America/New_York
        security_opt:
            - seccomp:unconfined
        shm_size: "1gb"
```
